## Why localStorage?
- When it came to data storage there were a couple options I considered for this project. First option I considered was having users create a local PostgreSQL database. I chose not to go with this option because this would add substantial setup steps for users (creating local database and running ORM script to create tables). Another option I considered was a Relational Database Service(RDS). With a RDS I would be able to manage the database myself meaning no setup for end users however, there are other issues introduced when using an RDS the main one being legality. Storing information without a proper Privacy Policy can lead to huge legal issues (e.g. California Suing Delta for $37 million) and I can't create a privacy policy at this moment in time so, until a time where I can create one I will stay away from an RDS. localStorage provides a locally hosted data storage solution that does not require any deployment or set up from the user making it a solution that solves the issues with the other solutions outlined above. It does introduce its own significant drawbacks, mainly the data can only be accessed from the browser on the computer that it was created on even though the user is accessing a live deployment (although with a local database you are also limited not to browser but to machine). Another drawback is the lack of actual database features. But, it fits the use case for this app well so, this is  the solution I decided to go with.
